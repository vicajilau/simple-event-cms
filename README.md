### üîß Configuration System

The template features a flexible multi-environment configuration system:

#### Environment Configuration

```dart
// Supported environments with different data sources
enum Environment {
  dev,    // Local development with local JSON files
  pre,    // Pre-production with GitHub raw files
  pro,    // Production with GitHub Pages
}

class ConfigLoader {
  static Environment currentEnvironment = Environment.dev;
  static Map<String, dynamic>? siteConfig;
  static String baseUrl = _getBaseUrl();
}
```

#### Data Structure

```dart
// Event configuration model
class SiteConfig {
  final String eventName;
  final EventDates dates;
  final Venue venue;
  final String description;
  final String? logoUrl;
  final Map<String, String> social;
}

// Agenda structure
class AgendaDay {
  final String date;
  final List<Track> tracks;
}

class Track {
  final String name;
  final List<Session> sessions;
}
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
